        "lore": "On first approach to Nestphar, a first-time visitor may be surprised by the soupy haze that bleeds from the planet’s atmosphere like a dusty cloud. This cloud consists of quadrillions of tiny living spores emitted by Nestphar’s many Flaah, city-sized floating forests in its stratosphere. The short-lived (and therefore continually resupplied) orbital presence of the Flaah spores allows the Arborec denizens in Nestphar’s space-stations and shipyards to remain in continuous symbiotic contact with their planet. The Arborec term for this vital connection, shared among all living things on Nestphar, is best translated as “the Symphony. When traveling beyond the reach of Nestphar’s Flaah spores, and therefore outside connection to the prime Symphony, the Arborec employ the massive Letani. Physically, the Letani are the largest sentient beings yet discovered in the galaxy (each slightly larger than a Sol Elephantus), their bodies resembling a kraken-shaped mushroom crossed with a monstrous carnivorous flower. The Letani are each uniquely capable of embodying a power in stance of the Symphony (and are therefore closest to an “individual” within Arborec society) which may act as a harmonica nexus for Arborec organisms in near proximity. All ships in the Arborec fleet are based around the presence of at least one (with some ships as many as five) Letani orchestrating the the unity of Arborec lifeforms crewing the vessel. Once a Letani returns to the embrace of Nestphar’s prime Symphony, its experiences are reconnected and absorbed into the Arborec, as a data-capsule would be reconnected to its mainframe. While surely intelligent and demonstrably capable of crafting impressive technologies, structures, and a sophisticated fleet of interstellar craft, the Arborec’s method of commutation remains a source of great controversy. Being a race of vegetative and fungal matter, handling its own data transmission and emotive projection through the prime Symphony, the Arborec have never developed any form of visual or auditory communication (concepts which, to this day, remain foreign to them). Arborec scientists found the solution to this dilemma in the Sol merchant vessel Dies Opulen. The crew of the Dies Opulen had tragically become in feted by Yborin Plague on Maaluk and had later died in deep space. When the derelict ship was found by an Arborec scout, it was determined the cool bodies of the human crew were in perfect condition for an ambitious experiment. The bodies were sent to the great laboratories in the Kishin, near the Arborec capital Phara. Here, final Arzuga cells were attached to the brainstems of the dead humans. It was hoped, when grown under proper conditions, the complex acidic properties of Arzuga would successfully merge the cells with the innate brain-tissue of the deceased subjects, slowly re-stimulating the neural pathways back to life. Then, by injecting photo-voltaic stems into the soft tissues of the dead body, the neurally active Arzuga would spur the soft tissue cells to heal and regrow, effective reanimating the dead body. Symbiotically attached to the host body the Arzuga fungi evolved into a new being, on which the Arborec call the Dirzuga. The Dirzusga were the missing link between the Symphony and the manifestation of physical communication that the Arborec lacked. Over the following few decades, the Arborec eagerly acquired additional subjects (human bodies seem to work best and are the most frequently used, but Letnev, Winnu, and Xxcha bodies are also commonly used as Dirzuga hosts), establishing a sizable diplomatic and trading corps that have become the basis for the Arborec’s interaction with the rest of the galaxy. The Arborec insist the host bodies of the Dirzuga are devoid of the expired individuals’ consciousness. With a cultural relationship to death rooted in the natural cycle of decomposition and regrowth, the Arborec have little understanding of sympathy for those who vigorously protect the bodies of their citizens being reused (some use the term “enslaved”) in such a manner. Ultimately, despite the objections of the dissident races, the Arborec were admitted as a member of the galactic council. The potential wealth of foodstuffs, medicines, and other treasures of Nestphar proved effective in overcoming any objections. While the Arborec insist that the past knowledge and experiences of the Dirzuga bodies do not persist beyond this reanimation, there are some who suspect the Arborec do not tell the entire truth. Such theorists can provide many examples in which the Arborec seem to have come upon information, or intimate understanding of other cultures, that seem inexplicable otherwise. "

        "lore": "In the very blackness of space lies cold, hard Arc Prime. Its system has no central star, and Arc Prime’s lack of defined orbit has been a mystery to scientists for millennia. It is a common jest that Arc Prime is simply afloat in space, and that only the Letnev disdain for the rest of the galaxy protects it from a fatal collision. The Letnev’s principal vassal, Wren Terra, shines like a mighty star in the ebon distance, while thorny military ships surround the dark plants like fireflies attracted to a black hole. Foreign visitors to Arc Prime will, under heavy fighter escort, be directed to the Dunlain Crater. The crater holds the sprawling city of Feruc, Arc Prime’s only city located on the planetary surface. Feruc is a pressurized mesh of icy black metal housing, belching industries, warehouses, and military installations. The thin atmosphere of Arc Prime prohibits normal surface life outside the cold pressurized facilities of Feruc. Since the barony has no use for the meager atmosphere of Arc Prime, it freely emits unfiltered pollutants from the underground Letnev cities and factories to the surface. A journey to Feruc is likely to leave a thick layer of frozen black residue on any vessel. It is a common merchant endearment to call a ship returning from Arc Prime a 'Chimney Sweeper.' Under the surface of Arc Prime, heated by its planetary core, the Baron presides over the proud and fierce Letnev people. Few non-natives have ever visited the capital Goz, fabled “city of a billion,” or the other six major underground urban centers of Arc Prime. A gray organic plant material, called Ao by the Letnev, is found everywhere in Arc Prime’s underground. It is Ao that supplies the oxygen to the enormous cavern-networks, and the plant is held in almost religious awe and respect by the Letnev people. Although tens of thousands of moist fungus caves are farmed by an army of intelligent machines, the Letnev’s great weakness has always been its shortage of food, liquid, medicines, and essential vitamins. The ancient Lazax kept the aggressive race in check by maintaining strict control of the Letnev food supplies and trade. Throughout the time of the Lazax empire, the Letnev led two unsuccessful rebellions agains the Imperium. Their history of dissension justified a constant imperial oversight of Arc Prime and its people. The Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole at the end of the Age of Dusk was started in protest over the Lazax sanctions and supervision. It was the Quann conflict that ignited the Twilight Wars and the final downfall of the empire. After Wren Terra was annexed by the Letnev during the latter years of the Age of Dusk, their colonies here have been primarily occupied with growing and supplying food for the population of Arc Prime. Foreign trade with the Letnev consists mainly of foodstuffs, for which merchants receive metals, weapons, and the sharp Saimoc - strong crystals used in mining operations across the galaxy. The Baron keeps order by maintaining a strict bureaucracy, discipline, and an elitist military culture that brings the strongest and the smartest directly under his control. The pale Letnev despise light, and will often wear protective headgear when visiting other worlds with bright sunlight. The legendary Letnev troops are only surpassed in brute strength by the Tekklar N’orr elite soldiers of distant Quinarra. With the new awakening of ambitions among the great races, the resurgence of interstellar commerce, and the recent momentum of the Galactic Council, the Baron has secretly been preparing to lead his people to final dominance. Baron Daz Emmiciel Werqan III has only one ambition: to become emperor at any cost.  "

        "lore": "Few historians dispute that the Saar were the first of the known races to venture into space but it remains unknown wether it was need or curiosity that drove the otherwise primitive people into such exploration. Their peaceful ways and dispersed civilization never promulgated them to official Lazax recognition. Some scholars have thus called them 'the forgotten race.'The tale of the Saar is a tragic one. Historical records are awash with accounts of deliberate planetary expulsions, even massacres of Saar settlements found on planets colonized by the other races. The musical Saar often chant the “Lay of Lisis” in memory of the largest known Saar colony prior to Ragh’s Call. After the planet of Lisis was annexed by the Sardakk N’orr no word came from the great Saar settlement there again. They simply disappeared. In their memory most Saar females wear a caefully carved silver pendant called the Y’ouf Lisis, or the “Tear of Lisis.” During the Houw Shanan, the Saar Holy Day, such pendants are given to young Saar women while Saar cubs throw beetles and insects into a raging fire and the elders howl at the starts with a longing rage. Before the Call began, the Saar were scattered across the galaxy existing at the mercy of other races. On dozens of worlds Saar could be found living in slums and sublevel cities working in the most noxious and despicable industries and making slim sustenance from the scraps of other civilizations. Considered unclean and barely sentient by other races, Saar life was cheap and subject to little justice. With hard work, polluted environments and no access to proper medical care, the bitter lives of the Saar were often short. It was in the hopeless middle period of the Dark Years that a single Saar, Ragh Gavar, would forever change the destiny of his people. Ragh made his living as the captain of an old scrap metal freighter that flew between Xxehan and Sol, a route that had been in his family for centuries. Despite being a capable trader, Ragh’s passion lay in poetry and the imagination of the pen, in the creation of succinct writings of hope scrawled on paper scraps during long trade hauls. At his ports of call other Saar would often congregate before his loading doors so that they might hear his latest versees and tales. Many of his listeners began to call him the “Captian of Hope.” Yet one year, Ragh did not arrivae at his destination. His rusty navigation system had finally failed and Ragh’s ship was lost among the stars. Floatingin unknown space, as his ancestors had once done so bravely before him, Ragh prayed that the One Between the Stars and would see him and his small crew home. The Call began a few years after Ragh Gavar’s disappearance. Throughout the great expansees of the galaxy every Saar began to feel within himself an unyielding longing for the stars and especially for a certain distant place beyond known space. Early followers of the Call found its origin in the great asteroid field of Jorun and here found a small but blossuming Saar colony on the two gigantic asteroids of Ragh and Lisis II. As the Call continued, Saar brethern from across the galaxy continued to arrive at Jorun, together building the infrastructure of civilization and hope for a lost race. Years before, Ragh’s ship had crashed on Jorun. Miraculously, he and his crew had survived and with great wonder they soon discovered the mineral richness, frozen water, atmospheric cavers and strange fauna that lay hidden within the endless ocean of rock. Yet Ragh was restless in his new home. it is told that the Captain awoke one night from a dream and then bade his crewmates farewell, disappearing into the great network of caverns that lies within the asteroid named after him. Ragh Gavar was never found or heard from again. but less then a month after his disappearance, the Call began. Saar mystics believe that the Captain of Hopes has joined the One Between the Sars and that he atlast won forgiveness for the Saar and has called them to relieve their suffering. They believe that Ragh’s Call has brough them home, that the life giving rocks surrounding them are the remnants of the ancient Saar planet of origin and that even in death it is giving its people a second life. For centuries the unified and passionate Saar people have built a formidable home and civilisation in the Jorun asteroid field. The Saar have finally found home and they have found that they are strong. "

        "lore": "It was during the early years of the Age of Dusk that Jol Nar exploreres came upon the volcanic planet of Muaat. Scouting for resources beyond the Mahact plateau the explorers were amazed by the mineral wealth of their discovery but they were truly awestruck by the extraordinary qualities of the plenets fiery inhabitants, the Gashlai. The Gashlai were unlike any race known to the Jol Nar; sentient beings with bodies slowly consubed by fiery heat. After their conception, Gashlai cocooning process somehow enables conversion of engery into mass – a process hinted at by scientific theory, but forever though unattainable on a subatomic scale. The Jol Nar beefited greatly from Muaat’s resource, yet they were frustrated in their attempts to replicate the Gashlai cocooning process. Instead the Gashlai proved useful as slave labour, as the Headmasters transformed the orbit of Muaat into a massive shipyard for their navy. It was here, at Muaat shipyards, that the construction of secret Jol Nar superweapon began. The Gashlai suffered under their enslavement by the Jol Nar, but events of the earlly Twilight Wars would dramatically change their fortune. Just after the Twilight Wars erupted, a Jol Nar expedition party searching for mineral deposits on Muaat became infected by an organism in the Doolak Mountains. The infection developed into a disease later know as the Doolak plague. The covert, yet frequent, traffic between Muaat and the Garian star system allowed for the spread of the virus to the Jol Nar home worlds. The plague became one of the greatest disasters in Jol Nar history and only the early research of Gashlai biology allowed the Headmasters to devise a vaccine before the entire Jol nar population was destroyed. Before the Jol Nar could fully recover from this disaster, their military offensive collasped and soon the Headmasters would face ruthless advance of the Sardakk N’orr. As the Jol Nar navy retreated the Headmasters were forced to call forth their secret weapon at Muaat. This weapon – an enormous battle vessel called a “War Sun” – was not yet entirely complete but with their fates clinging to the defenses of the Saudor system the Headmasters had no choice but to bring it to bear against the enemy. As the War Sun left its Muaat moorings and as the majority of the remaining Jol Nar personnel left with it, the Gashlai finally carved their own destiny. Having long schemed against their enslavers they incinerated the remaining Jol Nar in the system capturing the shipyards and every available scientific document left behind by their hated oppressors. Not long after their costly victory at Saudor, the Jol Nar sought to return to their colony at Muaat but found that all communications with the system had been severed. Exploratory ships sent to Muaat would not return. Though the Headmasterssuspected what might have taken place on their old colony, they were unable to return there in force again. Throughout the long Dark Years, the Gashlai prospered. Clad in Ember suits, special body armor shielding the Gashlai from cold and others from their lethal heat, a large assembly of Gashlai envoys ahve recently arrived at Mecatol Rex, demanding recognition and representation. The High Fire Warden Sushon Azh has simultaneously sent forth Gashlai ambassadors to all the great races in the distinctive gold-bronze frigates of Gashlai. Yet one such ambassador did not arrive in a frigate. As the Gashlai ambassador assigned to the Jol Nar sailed past the Garian star and began his approach to Jol, the Headmasters paled in fear; for their representative arrived in a War Sun, a copy of their own ancient designs. The message was not wasted on the Headmasters. Their former slaves had become formidable and they had not fogotten or forgiven the past. Led by the Fire Wardens, the Gashlai are resolved to never be enslaved again. insdie their golden Ember suitsthey burn with ambition. The Jol Nar fear what the rest of the galaxy is about to learn: that the Embers of Muaat intend to bring their fire to the furthest reaches of space, burning the unwilling into submission."

        "lore": "Under the punishing rays of the massive star Kenara lies the tri-system of Hacan. Each of its three satellites wrapped in the yellow haze so distinctive of desert planets. These three jewels are called Arretze, Kamdorn and Hercant. Here, the united Emirates of the Hacan have grown a mighty civilization of warriors, nomads, farmers and above all; merchants. The Kenara system is one of the most heavily trafficked in the known universe. Only the wormhole portal systems see more traffic in any given cycle. From Kenara an untold number of Hacan and other merchant vessels traverse the galaxy. This traffic is supported by entire cities of space stations that provide the warehousing, logistics, maintenance, banking , entertainment and other necessities facilitating the constant flow of goods, ships and crew. On the surface of the three hot desert planets, life is slower and more serene. Only life in the city of Harcarun on the planet Arretze matches the breathless pace of the space above. Lovated in a shadowy vale near the Arretze northern pole, Harcarun is the only city in the tri-system that has a fixed position. Its permanent location and almost bearable climatehas made Harcarun the primary point of operation for most non-native trading corporations, financiers and oppurtunists. The Hacan, despite the uncanny ability for establishing financial relationships and building trade, generally despise the chaotic lifestyle, and, to them, windy cold of Harcarun. The Hacan people dwell mostly in cities built on massive dust-sleds, constantly moving to cooler climates as the desert seasons shift. Although some technology has been introduced in the last hundred years, most Hacan cities are still pulled by vast herds of Tuuran beasts, whose gill-like skin membrances take moisture from the very air itself. In their distant past, the Hacan were a poor species, their exploits into space dwarfed by the other great races of the Imperium. Then slowly the Hacan discovered an insatiable off-worlder lust for special products grown under the Kenara’s blinding light of dug from the deep sands of their home worlds, the intoxicating gerr root, clothes made from the starflowers that only rise during the Hercant’s equinox, Spehat aphrodisiacs, liquors, medicines and forbidden drugs: All harvested and manufactured by the craft and patient hands of the Hacan. Soon the Hacan became master of trade and their system prospered as unfathomable fortunes were made by the increasingly powerful trading clans, chief among them the Mowshir Emirate of Arretze. The desire to protect their newfound wealth and a will to peacefully regulate and arbitrate between the clans, moved the Hacan to form a representative gathering and to elect a Quieron – the leader who speaks for all the Hacan. The Quieron leads the entire hierarchy of trade-groups, each possessing its own fleets of commerce and war. His task: to lead his people to the Imperial Throne, establishing an era of wealth and peaceful commerce."

            "lore": "Nestled in the third orbit of the Sol system lies Jord, the ancestral home of the human race. Few planets can rival Jord’s diversity of climates, seasons and ecology. Much of this wealth is attributed to its enormous moon, which causes dramatic tidal motions in Jor’s oceans, which is thought to be the impetus of its diverse life and weather patterns. Much of Jord’s orbit, as well as its moon, is crowded with stellar traffic from the orbital and lunar space stations. Military ships of the line, bearing the distinctive Sol symbol are often moored to the bulky military platforms in Jord’s orbit, or to the fleetbase Churchill Prima that orbits the reddish fourth planet of the system. The humans themselves represent the most numerous and most diverse species of the galaxy. Since the discovery of the mass-drive, humans have left Jord to explore and they continue to explore the distant corners of space. Humans can be found in all corners of the galaxy and seem to demonstrate the greatest variation in intellect and application of skills. Human colonies and settlements can be found everywhere as can human servants, traders, cartographers, explorers, mercenaries, scholars, construction crews, smugglers, scientists, diplomats, ect. It is commonly recognized among galactic historians that it has been the diversified skills of the human race that has been the determining factor in it avoiding annihilation or extinction. Of the untold billions of humans that dwell across the galaxy, all of whose ancestors once migrated from the Sol system, most feel no allegiance or kinship to the Sol Federation or the humans of Jord. Some feel a traditional friendship, while a few remain loyal to Sol and its policies. Being the last civilization to be admitted into the imperial council, it is ironic that Sol was the first to openly declare war against the failing empire. It was a Sol fleet that fired the first shot at the Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole, escalating the minor conflict into the full scale galactic war known as the Twilight Wars. The Sol Federation of Nations is governed by the bi-annually elected High Minister who has the executive control of the economy, budget and Sol Military. The executive powers of the High Minister are held in check by three distinct governing houses: The House of Law, The House of the People and The House of Industry. The four governing bodies of the Federation are all centrally located in the massive metropolis of New Moscow, a bustling center of politics, trade and high culture. The current High Minister, Juan Salvador Tao, is preparing for a new age that he knows is rapidly evolving before him. He is eager to expand the official colonization of Sol once more, especially to the old colonies of Centauri, Gral and Quann. He knows that the balance of power is shifting and that the universe will soon once again be governed under one empire. The High Minister will make sure that his Federation will prevail during the coming power struggle and inevitable war. Already the Sol fleet awaits his command to strike nearby systems. Soon the human destiny will be fulfilled and the distant suns theirs to command."
