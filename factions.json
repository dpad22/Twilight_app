        "lore": "On first approach to Nestphar, a first-time visitor may be surprised by the soupy haze that bleeds from the planet’s atmosphere like a dusty cloud. This cloud consists of quadrillions of tiny living spores emitted by Nestphar’s many Flaah, city-sized floating forests in its stratosphere. The short-lived (and therefore continually resupplied) orbital presence of the Flaah spores allows the Arborec denizens in Nestphar’s space-stations and shipyards to remain in continuous symbiotic contact with their planet. The Arborec term for this vital connection, shared among all living things on Nestphar, is best translated as “the Symphony. When traveling beyond the reach of Nestphar’s Flaah spores, and therefore outside connection to the prime Symphony, the Arborec employ the massive Letani. Physically, the Letani are the largest sentient beings yet discovered in the galaxy (each slightly larger than a Sol Elephantus), their bodies resembling a kraken-shaped mushroom crossed with a monstrous carnivorous flower. The Letani are each uniquely capable of embodying a power in stance of the Symphony (and are therefore closest to an “individual” within Arborec society) which may act as a harmonica nexus for Arborec organisms in near proximity. All ships in the Arborec fleet are based around the presence of at least one (with some ships as many as five) Letani orchestrating the the unity of Arborec lifeforms crewing the vessel. Once a Letani returns to the embrace of Nestphar’s prime Symphony, its experiences are reconnected and absorbed into the Arborec, as a data-capsule would be reconnected to its mainframe. While surely intelligent and demonstrably capable of crafting impressive technologies, structures, and a sophisticated fleet of interstellar craft, the Arborec’s method of commutation remains a source of great controversy. Being a race of vegetative and fungal matter, handling its own data transmission and emotive projection through the prime Symphony, the Arborec have never developed any form of visual or auditory communication (concepts which, to this day, remain foreign to them). Arborec scientists found the solution to this dilemma in the Sol merchant vessel Dies Opulen. The crew of the Dies Opulen had tragically become in feted by Yborin Plague on Maaluk and had later died in deep space. When the derelict ship was found by an Arborec scout, it was determined the cool bodies of the human crew were in perfect condition for an ambitious experiment. The bodies were sent to the great laboratories in the Kishin, near the Arborec capital Phara. Here, final Arzuga cells were attached to the brainstems of the dead humans. It was hoped, when grown under proper conditions, the complex acidic properties of Arzuga would successfully merge the cells with the innate brain-tissue of the deceased subjects, slowly re-stimulating the neural pathways back to life. Then, by injecting photo-voltaic stems into the soft tissues of the dead body, the neurally active Arzuga would spur the soft tissue cells to heal and regrow, effective reanimating the dead body. Symbiotically attached to the host body the Arzuga fungi evolved into a new being, on which the Arborec call the Dirzuga. The Dirzusga were the missing link between the Symphony and the manifestation of physical communication that the Arborec lacked. Over the following few decades, the Arborec eagerly acquired additional subjects (human bodies seem to work best and are the most frequently used, but Letnev, Winnu, and Xxcha bodies are also commonly used as Dirzuga hosts), establishing a sizable diplomatic and trading corps that have become the basis for the Arborec’s interaction with the rest of the galaxy. The Arborec insist the host bodies of the Dirzuga are devoid of the expired individuals’ consciousness. With a cultural relationship to death rooted in the natural cycle of decomposition and regrowth, the Arborec have little understanding of sympathy for those who vigorously protect the bodies of their citizens being reused (some use the term “enslaved”) in such a manner. Ultimately, despite the objections of the dissident races, the Arborec were admitted as a member of the galactic council. The potential wealth of foodstuffs, medicines, and other treasures of Nestphar proved effective in overcoming any objections. While the Arborec insist that the past knowledge and experiences of the Dirzuga bodies do not persist beyond this reanimation, there are some who suspect the Arborec do not tell the entire truth. Such theorists can provide many examples in which the Arborec seem to have come upon information, or intimate understanding of other cultures, that seem inexplicable otherwise. "

        "lore": "In the very blackness of space lies cold, hard Arc Prime. Its system has no central star, and Arc Prime’s lack of defined orbit has been a mystery to scientists for millennia. It is a common jest that Arc Prime is simply afloat in space, and that only the Letnev disdain for the rest of the galaxy protects it from a fatal collision. The Letnev’s principal vassal, Wren Terra, shines like a mighty star in the ebon distance, while thorny military ships surround the dark plants like fireflies attracted to a black hole. Foreign visitors to Arc Prime will, under heavy fighter escort, be directed to the Dunlain Crater. The crater holds the sprawling city of Feruc, Arc Prime’s only city located on the planetary surface. Feruc is a pressurized mesh of icy black metal housing, belching industries, warehouses, and military installations. The thin atmosphere of Arc Prime prohibits normal surface life outside the cold pressurized facilities of Feruc. Since the barony has no use for the meager atmosphere of Arc Prime, it freely emits unfiltered pollutants from the underground Letnev cities and factories to the surface. A journey to Feruc is likely to leave a thick layer of frozen black residue on any vessel. It is a common merchant endearment to call a ship returning from Arc Prime a 'Chimney Sweeper.' Under the surface of Arc Prime, heated by its planetary core, the Baron presides over the proud and fierce Letnev people. Few non-natives have ever visited the capital Goz, fabled “city of a billion,” or the other six major underground urban centers of Arc Prime. A gray organic plant material, called Ao by the Letnev, is found everywhere in Arc Prime’s underground. It is Ao that supplies the oxygen to the enormous cavern-networks, and the plant is held in almost religious awe and respect by the Letnev people. Although tens of thousands of moist fungus caves are farmed by an army of intelligent machines, the Letnev’s great weakness has always been its shortage of food, liquid, medicines, and essential vitamins. The ancient Lazax kept the aggressive race in check by maintaining strict control of the Letnev food supplies and trade. Throughout the time of the Lazax empire, the Letnev led two unsuccessful rebellions agains the Imperium. Their history of dissension justified a constant imperial oversight of Arc Prime and its people. The Letnev blockade of the Quann wormhole at the end of the Age of Dusk was started in protest over the Lazax sanctions and supervision. It was the Quann conflict that ignited the Twilight Wars and the final downfall of the empire. After Wren Terra was annexed by the Letnev during the latter years of the Age of Dusk, their colonies here have been primarily occupied with growing and supplying food for the population of Arc Prime. Foreign trade with the Letnev consists mainly of foodstuffs, for which merchants receive metals, weapons, and the sharp Saimoc - strong crystals used in mining operations across the galaxy. The Baron keeps order by maintaining a strict bureaucracy, discipline, and an elitist military culture that brings the strongest and the smartest directly under his control. The pale Letnev despise light, and will often wear protective headgear when visiting other worlds with bright sunlight. The legendary Letnev troops are only surpassed in brute strength by the Tekklar N’orr elite soldiers of distant Quinarra. With the new awakening of ambitions among the great races, the resurgence of interstellar commerce, and the recent momentum of the Galactic Council, the Baron has secretly been preparing to lead his people to final dominance. Baron Daz Emmiciel Werqan III has only one ambition: to become emperor at any cost.  "

        "lore": "Few historians dispute that the Saar were the first of the known races to venture into space but it remains unknown wether it was need or curiosity that drove the otherwise primitive people into such exploration. Their peaceful ways and dispersed civilization never promulgated them to official Lazax recognition. Some scholars have thus called them 'the forgotten race.'The tale of the Saar is a tragic one. Historical records are awash with accounts of deliberate planetary expulsions, even massacres of Saar settlements found on planets colonized by the other races. The musical Saar often chant the “Lay of Lisis” in memory of the largest known Saar colony prior to Ragh’s Call. After the planet of Lisis was annexed by the Sardakk N’orr no word came from the great Saar settlement there again. They simply disappeared. In their memory most Saar females wear a caefully carved silver pendant called the Y’ouf Lisis, or the “Tear of Lisis.” During the Houw Shanan, the Saar Holy Day, such pendants are given to young Saar women while Saar cubs throw beetles and insects into a raging fire and the elders howl at the starts with a longing rage. Before the Call began, the Saar were scattered across the galaxy existing at the mercy of other races. On dozens of worlds Saar could be found living in slums and sublevel cities working in the most noxious and despicable industries and making slim sustenance from the scraps of other civilizations. Considered unclean and barely sentient by other races, Saar life was cheap and subject to little justice. With hard work, polluted environments and no access to proper medical care, the bitter lives of the Saar were often short. It was in the hopeless middle period of the Dark Years that a single Saar, Ragh Gavar, would forever change the destiny of his people. Ragh made his living as the captain of an old scrap metal freighter that flew between Xxehan and Sol, a route that had been in his family for centuries. Despite being a capable trader, Ragh’s passion lay in poetry and the imagination of the pen, in the creation of succinct writings of hope scrawled on paper scraps during long trade hauls. At his ports of call other Saar would often congregate before his loading doors so that they might hear his latest versees and tales. Many of his listeners began to call him the “Captian of Hope.” Yet one year, Ragh did not arrivae at his destination. His rusty navigation system had finally failed and Ragh’s ship was lost among the stars. Floatingin unknown space, as his ancestors had once done so bravely before him, Ragh prayed that the One Between the Stars and would see him and his small crew home. The Call began a few years after Ragh Gavar’s disappearance. Throughout the great expansees of the galaxy every Saar began to feel within himself an unyielding longing for the stars and especially for a certain distant place beyond known space. Early followers of the Call found its origin in the great asteroid field of Jorun and here found a small but blossuming Saar colony on the two gigantic asteroids of Ragh and Lisis II. As the Call continued, Saar brethern from across the galaxy continued to arrive at Jorun, together building the infrastructure of civilization and hope for a lost race. Years before, Ragh’s ship had crashed on Jorun. Miraculously, he and his crew had survived and with great wonder they soon discovered the mineral richness, frozen water, atmospheric cavers and strange fauna that lay hidden within the endless ocean of rock. Yet Ragh was restless in his new home. it is told that the Captain awoke one night from a dream and then bade his crewmates farewell, disappearing into the great network of caverns that lies within the asteroid named after him. Ragh Gavar was never found or heard from again. but less then a month after his disappearance, the Call began. Saar mystics believe that the Captain of Hopes has joined the One Between the Sars and that he atlast won forgiveness for the Saar and has called them to relieve their suffering. They believe that Ragh’s Call has brough them home, that the life giving rocks surrounding them are the remnants of the ancient Saar planet of origin and that even in death it is giving its people a second life. For centuries the unified and passionate Saar people have built a formidable home and civilisation in the Jorun asteroid field. The Saar have finally found home and they have found that they are strong. "
